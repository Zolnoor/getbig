        Never thought others would take a look at this.

            GetBig is an Android app designed to help weight lifters,
        body builders, and plain old gym rats track their progress through the
        use of a simple to use and intuitive app. The experience was designed to
        recreate the classic use of just pencil and paper to jot down your lifts,
        reps, and whether or not you had to be spotted for the last two sets!
